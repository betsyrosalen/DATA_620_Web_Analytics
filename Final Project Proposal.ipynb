    "Your proposal should describe at a high level what you’re seeking to accomplish, and your motivation for performing this analysis. A guiding question or hypothesis to test is one good way to start. If you are going to work in a small group (encouraged!), you should also list your partners’ names. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should briefly describe your data sources; plan for doing the work, and up-front concerns. If you are working in a group, please describe the roles and responsibilities of each group member. \n",

    "Your project should incorporate one or both of the two main themes of this course: network analysis and text processing. You need to show all of your work in a coherent workflow, and in a reproducible format, such as an IPython Notebook or an R Markdown document. If you are building a model or models, explain how you evaluate the “goodness” of the chosen model and parameters. \n",

    "You may work in a team of up to three people. Each project team member is responsible for understanding and being able to explain all of the submitted project code. Remember that you can take work that you find elsewhere as a base to build on, but you need to acknowledge the source, so that I base your grade on what you contributed, not on what you started with!"

    "> For their 2011 paper, “Flavor network and the principles of food pairing,” four scientists analyzed 56,498 recipes downloaded from three websites — allrecipes.com, epicurious.com, and menupan.com. To support their findings, the authors published two datasets. One names the cuisine and ingredients for each recipe. The other dataset counts how often any two ingredients appeared in the same recipe. (Parmesan cheese and beef appeared together 93 times; starfruit and Algerian geranium oil just once.)

    "We are interested in examining the similarities and differences between world cuisines in order to understand how human eating behavior is alike or dissimilar across cultures and continents.

Some initial ideas for analysis include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. analyze as a bipartite network with cuisines and ingredients acting as the two nodes to show differences and commonalities between cuisines.  Edges between cuisine nodes and ingredient nodes would represent ingredients found in recipes from both cuisines and be weighted by the number of occurrences.\n",
    "2. look at every unique pair of ingredients in each recipe and get counts by cuisine to see which ingredients most commonly go together for each cuisine and similarities and differences between common pairings by cuisine\n",
    "3. text analysis to find the most common ingredients for each cuisine and compare across cuisines.\n",
    "4. statistical analysis of the average number of ingredients per recipe by cuisine."

    "Additionally, the broad categories of the cuisine types may be too broad to capture regional cuisines that are significantly different than their near neighbors.  For example, all of South and Central America are lumped together in one \"LatinAmerican\" category (that may also include other regions).  The cuisines of Argentina and Mexico may be just as dissimilar from each other as they are from Italian or French cuisine, and the same goes for the four European categories, three Asian categories, African, MiddleEastern, and North American categories.  There is so much variation among the cuisines within each of these regions that differences amoung cuisines be masked by aggregating data from all of these more local cuisines into such broad categories.
