# DATA620_Fall2019_Project3
##### Group Project for CUNY SPS MSDS DATA 620 Fall 2019
##### Baron Curtin, Heather Geiger, Mikhail Groysman, Betsy Rosalen

For this project, please work as a collaborative group! Your project should be submitted (as a Jupyter Notebook via GitHub) by end of the due date. The group should present their code and findings in our meetup.

_The ability to be an effective member of a virtual team is highly valued in the data science job market._


## Project Outline

Using any of the three classifiers described in chapter 6 of ___Natural Language Processing with Python___, and any features you can think of, build the best name gender classifier you can.

Begin by splitting the Names Corpus into three subsets: 500 words for the test set, 500 words for the dev-test set, and the remaining 6900 words for the training set. Then, starting with the example name gender classifier, make incremental improvements. Use the dev-test set to check your progress. Once you are satisfied with your classifier, check its final performance on the test set.

How does the performance on the test set compare to the performance on the dev-test set? Is this what you'd expect?

## Collaboration - Kanban Board (Projects)

Please check out the Kanban Board project on the "[Projects](https://github.com/betsyrosalen/DATA620_Fall2019_Project3/projects)" tab in this repo in GitHub and click on "[DATA 620 Fall 2019 Project 3](https://github.com/betsyrosalen/DATA620_Fall2019_Project3/projects/1)".  I suggest we use this to help organize the distribution of tasks and keep track of who is working on what.  There are basic instructions about how to use the project board in the project itself on the left side, so check it out!  

**Please create a new card to let the group know what you are working on.**

**Questions and issues** can be added to the [Issues](https://github.com/betsyrosalen/DATA620_Fall2019_Project3/issues) tab in this repo.


## Adding Contributions to the Repository

There are basically two ways to contribute to the repository.

1. If you are a collaborator, you can make changes and commit them directly to the repo. If you want to be a collaborator let me know and I will add you.
2. If you are not a collaborator, you can fork the repo, make changes to your forked version and submit a pull request that one of the collaborators will need to approve and merge with the master branch repo.  

**Preferably each collaborator should work in a separate branch.**
